Slave application | Mobile Offloading Project 

The motive of this project is to develop a distributed computing system using mobile devices. Two separate Android applications have been developed to demonstrate mobile offloading in a Master-Slave architecture. The master device scans for available slave devices and sends a notification to participating slave devices to connect and send their location and battery information. The connection between the devices is achieved. The master distributes the task of matrix multiplication by assigning and sending separate rows to the slave devices and once it receives the result back, it compiles it to generates the final output.
